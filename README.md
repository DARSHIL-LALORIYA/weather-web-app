I created a Simple Weather website/app using Node.js, Express, EJS and we’ll be also using some dependencies such as AXIOS, Body-Parser and Nodemon.
The website is going to have two main features which are Searching and displaying Weather information.
The data for the information will come from OpenWeatherMap API  , but feel free to use whatever API you wish.
some good suggestions:
<ul>
  <li> Tomorrow.io API</li>
  <li> Stormglass API</li>
  <li> AccuWeather API</li>
</ul>
<h3>Initialize the New Project</h3>
To initialise a new Node.js project all you have to do is to create a new project folder “weather-app” or anything you call it and then run the Command line in the same directory. Once you do that to initialise a new project simply put the following command:
<h4 >npm init -y</h4>
